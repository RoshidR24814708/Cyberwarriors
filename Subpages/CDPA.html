		<strong>Copyright, Designs and Patents Act’s (1988)</strong>
	</h1>
	<p>
		The Copyright, Designs and Patents Act’s (1988) main function is to grant the protection of ideas in the form of designs and patents to their respectful owners, performers and organizations.  
	</p>
	<p>
		Copyright is a set of protected entitlements which works can possess. Types of work which can be copyrighted include artistic works (including literature), recordings and published texts. In a more obvious relationship to computing, Databases – which is defined as a collection of works that have been systematically organized and can be accessed separately by individuals – can be legally restricted under copyright. It also requires notable effort put into constructing the database including establishing its contents.  
	</p>

	<p>
		The reason for Copyright Law’s conception is the strong, long-held belief that authors should be fairly credited for their work (including receiving financial compensation), to incentivize the creation of other original works and – conversely - to allow works to be available to the public for them to enjoy and derive ideas from. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Significant rights that copyright owners obtain under this regulation include: 
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			The right to publicly distribute the work. Public can mean involving those outside of a private or domestic environment. 
		</li>
		<li>
			The right to perform the work in public - performing is defined as a visual or sonic performance.  
		</li>
		<li>
			The right to publish the materials as physical copies or electronic files available on the internet. 
		</li>
		<li>
			The right to grant others the ability to recreate or redistribute their work. 
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		The duration of copyright can vary between works; for artistic works, it is not until 70 years after the author’s death that the work enters the public domain. For a database, its rights are reserved only for 15 years after completion. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Failure to respect the rights of a work by redistributing it without the copyright holder’s permission can lead to a maximum of two years in prison 
	</p>
	<p>
		One instance where using work protected under CDPA does not infringe upon its rights is when the work is being criticized or reviewed such as an educational YouTube video about a published book not yet available in the public domain. 
		The portion of the work required cannot exceed more than what is required for the review. Furthermore, the review must have valid relation to the work 
	</p>
	<p>
		An example of CDPA being applied in the real world involves file sharing services such as Napster which allowed for rampant piracy and distribution of music between users without monetary compensation to the respective artists. More recently, BitTorrent had been under fire for the decentralized sharing of files across the internet using peer-to-peer.
