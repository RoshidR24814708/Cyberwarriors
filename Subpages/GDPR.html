			<strong>General Data Protection Act (2018)</strong>
		</h1>
		<p>
			The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a European Union (EU) regulation implemented in 2018. It governs data protection and privacy, introducing stricter guidelines and standards that businesses should implement to protect the personal data of European consumers. Any business that processes the data of individuals in the EU must comply to GDPR, giving customers the right to withdraw consent to process their data, as well as enabling them to have more control over how their personal data is being processed. 		
		</p>
		<p>
			Many countries outside of the EU have their own data protection regulations which are like GDPR, such as the UK’s Data Protection Act, which has extra provisions for businesses in the UK on top of the GDPR regulation. 
		</p>
			Authorities that process the personal data of individuals are considered Data Controllers. They have the responsibility of keeping the data subject’s data safe. More information about the data controller can be found in article 24 of GDPR. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Third parties that process the data for controllers are called Data Processors. They must follow the processors orders and are also responsible for keeping the subject’s data secure. More information about the data processor can be found in article 28 of GDPR 
		</p>
		<h2>
			The Core Principles of GDPR
		</h2>
		<p>
			GDPR is built upon several core principles regarding the storing, sharing and processing of personal data which are: 
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Transparency: the business must be transparent when telling consumers what their data is being used for 
			</li>
			<li>
				Purpose: data must be collected with a legitimate purpose 
			</li>
			<li>
				Minimisation: businesses should limit data collection to what is necessary for their purpose 
			</li>
			<li>
				Accuracy: data should be kept up to date 
			</li>
			<li>
				Storage: data shouldn’t be kept longer than necessary, and should be disposed of responsibly without any security risks 
			</li>
			<li>
				Confidentiality: data should be stored securely to prevent unauthorised access and data breaches. 
			</li>
			<li>
				Accountability: businesses should comply to GDPR and demonstrate what they’ve done to comply. 
			</li>
		</ol>
		<h2>
			Individual Rights
		</h2>
		<p>
			GDPR enables individuals to have greater freedom and control over how their data is stored and processed, including being able to withdraw consent to give their personal data at any given time. Some rights include: 
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Article 15 - Right of Access: the data subject has the right to request access of their personal data and what its being used for free of charge 
			</li>
			<li>
				Article 16 – Right of Correction: data subjects have the right to correct the data that is held about them. 
			</li>
			<li>
				Article 17 – Right to Forget: data subjects have the right to withdraw consent to the processing of their data if they believe that it’s no longer justified. 
			</li>
			<li>
				Article 21 – Right to Object: data subjects have the right to object to the processing of their data for things like marketing or other legitimate interests. 
			</li>
			<li>
				Article 20 – Right of Portability: data subjects have the right to request their personal data and transfer it to another data controller. 
			</li>
		</ol>
		<h2>
			How Does This Impact Organisations? 
		</h2>
		<p>
			Many organisations needed to change their policies, security procedures and documentation to comply with GDPR legislation. This includes measures such as: 
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Hiring a Data Protection Officer: this role is independent from the business and requires the individual to oversee the data security measures implemented by the business. Any business that regularly processes personal information needs a DPO. 
			</li>
			<li>
				More complex documentation and considerations: one example is the Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA), which analyses how an organisation handles personal information. This is required in article 36 of GDPR. These documentations allow businesses to display that they are following GDPR correctly. 
			</li>
			<li>
				Data Breach Notification: the data subject should be notified in detail as soon as possible when a breach is discovered. A supervisory authority must be notified of a breach within 72 hours of its discovery if the breach leaks data that risks the rights of the data subject. 
			</li>
		</ol>
		<h2>
			Consequences of Breaching GDPR 
		</h2>
		<p>
			GDPR isn’t just a legal constraint, it helps to build trust between companies and their consumers. Consumers know that companies collect data about them, so breaching GDPR legislation can result in a bad reputation, affecting the trust of the consumer, resulting in less sales. 
		</p>
		<p>
			However, there are legal consequences of breaching GDPR, with fines of up to £20M, or 4% their annual income, whichever is higher. Regulatory authorities ,such as the ICO in the UK or the EDPS in the EU, can also stop the operations of the business if deemed necessary, preventing the organisation from processing any data and continuing operations until it has met GDPR regulations again.
