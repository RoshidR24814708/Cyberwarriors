			<strong>Telecommunications (Security) Act 2021</strong>
		</h1>
		<p>
			Originally established in 1984, The Telecommunications Act was introduced to regulate the telecommunications industry in the UK. It allowed British Telecom (BT) to be privatised and set rules for telecom providers. The law also gave the government the power to intervene in telecom operations for national security reasons. 		
		</p>
		<p>
			The law was updated in 2021 (Telecommuncations Act 2021) to address modern cybersecurity threats. As technology has advanced with the likes of 5G networks, cloud computing, Internet of Things (IoT) devices and smart home technology, cyber threats have become a bigger problem, and weak security in telecom networks could allow hackers to steal information or disrupt services. The new law introduced stricter security regulations for telecom providers and requires them to strengthen their networks against cyber threats.  
		</p>
		<h2>
			Why Does this Legislation Exist?
		</h2>
		<p>
			One key reason for the act’s existence is to establish a legal framework that holds telecom companies accountable for network security. Weak security in telecom infrastructure could allow hackers to exploit vulnerabilities, leading to stolen personal and business data, disrupted emergency services, or compromised national security. By enforcing stricter security regulations, the act aims to reduce these risks and enhance the overall resilience of the UK’s telecommunications networks.  
		</p>
        <h2>
			The Core Principles of the Telecommunications Act
		</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Forces telecom companies to strengthen cybersecurity. 
			</li>
			<li>
				Allows the government to ban high-risk telecom vendors or equipment.
			</li>
			<li>
				Requires telecom providers to identify and reduce risks to their networks. 
			</li>
			<li>
				Sets huge fines for companies that do not comply (up to £100,000 per day).
			</li>
		</ol>
		<h2>
			What does this legislation cover?
		</h2>
		<h3>
            Protecting Networks from Cyber Threats:
        </h3>
        <p>
            The act requires telecom providers to implement strong cybersecurity measures to prevent hacking, espionage, and data breaches that could compromise user privacy or national security.  
		</p>
		<h3>
            Ensuring Resilience Against Cyberattacks:
        </h3>
        <p>
            The legislation mandates that networks must be designed to withstand cyberattacks, allowing essential services like emergency communications and financial transactions to remain operational even if hackers try to disrupt them. 
        </p>
        <h3>
            Banning High-Risk Vendors: 
        </h3>
        <p>
            The legislation gives the government the power to ban telecom providers from using equipment or services from high-risk vendors which may pose security threats, such as those linked to foreign state influence. 
        </p>
        <h3>
            Risk Assessment: 
        </h3>
        <p>
            Providers are required to implement risk management processes to identify, assess, and mitigate potential threats to their networks and services. 
        </p>
        <h3>
            Government Oversight and Intervention: 
        </h3>
        <p>
            The act gives the UK government authority to intervene when there is a national security risk, including ordering telecom providers to remove or replace insecure infrastructure.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Incident Reporting and Response Plans:
        </h3>
        <p>
            Telecom companies must report security incidents affecting their networks promptly, including incidents that could impact availability, integrity, or confidentiality. They are also required to have response plans in place to mitigate damage and restore services quickly. 
        </p>
		<h2>
			Consequences of Non-Compiance 
		</h2>
		<p>
			If a telecom provider consistently fails to meet the requirements, legal action could be taken. This could involve further investigations into the company’s practices, with potential for even stricter penalties, including legal fees or forced settlements. Repeated non-compliance could lead to more severe enforcement measures. 
		</p>
		<p>
            Telecom companies found in violation of the security regulations may face operational disruptions, especially if the government orders the removal or replacement of insecure infrastructure. This could cause delays, service outages, or even forced shutdowns.
        </p>
        <p>
            With telecom services playing such a critical role in daily life, society is becoming more aware of data security. A telecom provider that consistently fails to follow the law may lose its competitive edge as customers turn to more reliable, secure alternatives. Over time, this could lead to a significant loss of market share.
        </p>
        <p>
            Providers who fail to comply with the legislation could be subject to more frequent and intensive audits by regulators. This can lead to higher costs and more administrative work for the company, as they must deal with compliance checks more often. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Companies in violation of the act may also find it difficult to secure future business deals or partnerships. Providers with a history of security breaches or non-compliance might receive a bad reputation and find it challenging to gain the trust of potential clients, investors, or business partners. 
        </p>
        <h3>
            Penalties for Non-Compliance: 
        </h3>
        <ol>
			<li>
				Companies can be fined up to 10% of their annual turnover or £100,000 per day for continued violations. 
			</li>
            <li>
                The penalties are based on the size of the company and the potential impact of any security breach. Larger providers face stricter requirements and higher fines, while smaller companies might face slightly less severe penalties. 
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>
            Example of legislation in effect
        </h2>
        <p>
            In June 2023, British Telecom experienced a major failure in its network, causing a serious disruption to the UK's emergency 999 call system. Nearly 14,000 emergency calls failed to connect, affecting police, ambulance, and fire services across the country. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The issue was caused by a malfunction in BT's system, which prevented emergency calls from being connected. This failure not only put lives at risk but also revealed flaws in BT's ability to protect essential services. BT was investigated under the Telecommunications Act 2021 for not meeting the security standards required for critical infrastructure. It was revealed that they had not sufficiently strengthened their systems against vulnerabilities. As a result, the company was fined £17.5 million. 
        </p>
        <p>
            To prevent similar issues in the future, BT made several improvements. They upgraded their systems to enhance reliability and ensure better monitoring and maintenance of critical services. A new notification system was also established between BT, emergency service and the UK government, allowing them to communicate more effectively and prevent similar incidents in the future. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The BT failure demonstrated what can happen when these security protocols are not followed; lives were at risk and the trust in essential services was compromised. Had BT adhered to the act's standards and implemented stronger security measures, the risk of such a failure could have been significantly reduced. The incident highlights the importance of consistent monitoring, risk assessments and proper system maintenance, to ensure that networks remain resilient to cyber threats and technical failures. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This incident is not just a wake-up call for BT, but also for other telecom companies. The consequences of failing to comply with the Telecommunications Act 2021 can be severe, and other companies in the industry should take note.
