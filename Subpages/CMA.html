			<strong>Computer Misuse Act (1990)</strong>
		</h1>
		<p>
			The computer misuse act 1990 is a law and regulation that regulates and criminalises any unauthorised access and modification of computers without the 3rd parties consent. This law also criminalises damage to any computer system and data. 	
		</p>
		<h2>
			Purpose
		</h2>
		<p>
			The purpose of the regulation is to protect the security of computer systems and data, this is to ensure that data does not get stolen and then used for something it should not be. This regulation also helps to stop cyber attacks from occurring. This is because it gives companies / organizations ways to defend themselves against cyber attacks and there also harsh penalties which will make people think twice in committing the crime. This also gives the police ways to prosecute cyber criminals when they attack organizations, which allows the criminals to be prosecuted more easily. 
		</p>
		<h2>
			Review of the Computer Misuse Act
		</h2>
		<p>
			In May 2021 the home secretary announced a review for the computer misuse act, this review was completed in 2023, this review involved getting opinions from stakeholders and the public. The review was based around considering if the computer misuse act was fit for purpose because of technological advances. The review also considered if the police had the required powers to investigate and prosecute cyber criminals.
