		<strong>Digital Operational Resilience Act (2023)</strong>
	</h1>
	<p>
		The Digital Operation Resilience Act (DORA) is an EU act that was passed to strengthen the IT security of financial entities such as banks, insurance companies and investment firms and making sure that the financial sector in Europe can stay resilient in the event of a severe operational disruption. ​(Authority, n.d.)​  
	</p>
	<p>
		DORA creates a binding, comprehensive information and communication technology (ICT) risk management framework for the EU financial sector. Financial Entities must implement the technical standards in their ICT laid down by the act as of 17th January 2025 as the law was passed on 16th January 2023. ​(IBM, 2023)​  
	</p>
	<h2>
		Why is DORA needed?  
	</h2>
	<p>
		We are living in an age where cyber-attacks have become quite prevalent and is leaving behind a damaging impact upon any institutions out there. Among them, financial sector has been one of those institutions which has also stood out to be vulnerable to these attacks carried out by the attackers.  	
	</p>
	<p>
		Because these institutions rely on digital systems, the entire interconnected financial sector must regularly withstand, respond to and recover from all types of digital disruptions and attacks. DORA is a legislative blueprint meant to undercut the criminal appeal of targeting financial institutions. Fragmented and inconsistent cybersecurity regulations among EU states created confusion for all business sectors. DORA seeks to build and maintain a unified approach throughout the EU financial sector, collectively managing risks in a consistent manner across national boundaries. ​(Patrizio, 2025)​ 	
	</p>
	<p>
		DORA can harmonize resilience standards across ​(metricstream, n.d.)​ the EU at the same time allowing robust relationships to foster stakeholder trust and allowing the market to stay confident and stable 
	</p>
	<h2>
		Components of DORA 
	</h2>
	<p>DORA’s framework revolves around five pillars which are as follows: </p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			ICT Risk Management 
		</li>
		<p>
			Entities are required to establish robust risk management frameworks that encompass preventive, detective, and corrective controls. This includes detailed policies and procedures for ICT governance and risk assessment. 
		</p>
		<li>
			Incident Reporting 
		</li>
		<p>
			A unified approach to incident reporting ensures timely communication of cyber incidents. Entities must notify regulators of significant incidents within a defined timeframe and provide periodic updates. 
		</p>
		<li>
			Digital Resilience Testing 
		</li>
		<p>
			Financial entities must conduct regular testing of their ICT systems, including advanced penetration testing for critical functions. These tests aim to identify and address vulnerabilities before they can be exploited. 
		</p>
		<li>
			ICT Third-Party Risk Management 
		</li>
		<p>
			DORA introduces stringent requirements for managing risks associated with third-party service providers. This includes mandatory contractual provisions and regular performance assessments. 
		</p>
		<li>
			Information Sharing 
		</li>
		<p>
			The regulation promotes the voluntary sharing of threat intelligence among financial entities, fostering a collaborative approach to cybersecurity. ​(metricstream, n.d.)​ 
		</p>
	</ul>
